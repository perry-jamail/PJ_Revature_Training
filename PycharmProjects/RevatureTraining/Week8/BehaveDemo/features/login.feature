Feature: User Authentication
  As a registered user
  I want to log into my account
  So that I can access my personalized dashboard

# Background runs before EVERY Scenario in the feature
# Useful in common pre-conditions
Background:
  Given the application is running
  And the test database is already seeded with users

# Scenario is like a test case with Given/When/Then
Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials

  # Given specifies a Pre-Condition
  Given the user is on the login page

  # When describes the action or actions being tested
  When the user enters username "tomsmith"
  And the user enters password "SuperSecretPassword!"
  And the user clicks the login button

  # Then describes the expected outcome
  Then the user should be redirected to the secure area
  And the page should display a message containing "You logged in"
